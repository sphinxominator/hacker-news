I wanted to keep things as simple as possible and went for plain CSS and JS without any dependencies, except for the font. Which means no minification, but also no webpack, npm or any tools were needed. It's a small job and we shouldn't need them for this.

I'm making use of native promises, which means IE is not supported, but all modern browsers are. A polyfill like https://github.com/taylorhakes/promise-polyfill could easily be provided if needed.

The HTML for the articles is generated by JS `document.` methods, which at this scale wasn't really a problem, but anything larger and a templating engine and jQuery would start making sense, if not going directly to something like React. And the structure of the code is even inspired by components.

The premise of the site is pretty simple. Treat every request as a promise, and wrap the request for all stories and all users into single promises, so we don't start requesting new things before we actually know where to look for it. So we get a simple chain of finding the top stories and picking 10 random, then grabbing their data, then grabbing the karma of the users we need.

There's a little more explanation in comments in the files.
