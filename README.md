I wanted to keep things as simple as possible and went for plain CSS and JS without any dependencies, except for the font. Which also means no webpack, npm or any tools were needed.

I'm making use of native promises, which means IE is not supported, but all modern browsers are. A polyfill like https://github.com/taylorhakes/promise-polyfill could easily be provided if needed.

The HTML for the articles is generated by JS `document.` methods, which at this scale wasn't really a problem, but anything larger and a templating engine and jQuery would start making sense, if not going directly to something like React. And the structure of the code is even inspired by components.
